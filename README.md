# webserver
Fork of my "bored" webserver turned into a dynamic command-line interface

## dependencies
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com) `npm i express`

## testing
Tested on macOS zsh 5.7.1

## how to use
1. Clone the Github repository locally by running `git clone https://github.com/phoebe-leong/webserver`
2. Add the cloned directory to the `PATH` variable by following the instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/nex3/c395b2f8fd4b02068be37c961301caa7)
3. Run `npm i -g` inside the cloned directory
4. You should now be able to use the command from anywhere on your computer
